## Physics Coursework

Completed my third TMA and the first one of 2025 today, and it was tough. We have been doing Fields, Potentials and circuits over Dec. Really hard to wrap your head around the differences between potential energy and potential at first, but you kind of get the hang of it. I need to go over almost everything we have done so far, but there is so much volume in this module it is crazy. I feel like I'm not really allocating enough time to my university work from focusing on Python, but I'm doing really well TMA wise so far so maybe it's ok.

I can get back on more Python and SQL this week. I plan to start doing some DataLemur questions by Feb and get ready to finish the advanced Mooc, but I also need to start pumping out some more projects for github. I have so much I need to do.

Almost forgot! The data engineering zoomcamp began this week, which I will be doing. Looks really good and will tie lots together that I have done before, and use GCP which I havent used yet. It will be good practice, I should make sure I keep on top of it.
