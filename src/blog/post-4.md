## Very busy and progressing

Last TMA was a bit of a disaster but still awaiting results, so hopeful doesnt bring my total mark down too much. I would be delighted to go into the exam with the chance to get a first, but a 2.1 would do nicely!

I have been very busy with Physics, and also building things to assist in my studies. I built a kind of REST API to keep track of the short questions I have completed in physics and some additional fields to present to myself in a dashboard, to help me keep track of what I need to focus on when it comes to revision. Integrated that into this site!

I also have a really promising software engineering interview coming up, which I am hopeful things go well and I can start working with these tools on a daily basis, and furthering my programming skills.

Lastly, I really want to start working on making this portfolio/blog site my own, but have much more pressing things to do. It serves its purpose currently, though I do have some ideas on what I want to do with it in the near future.
