## Developing the public facing professional side

I have made some steps towards making myself look more professional and working on my image, setting up my own domain and email address domain. I thought it was going to be so much more complicated than it actually is to set up in the end, and all the research I did into the 'best' email server was essentially curtailed by the fact I'm already paying for icloud+ so decided to use that, as I don't see any immediate need to scale in the near future, especially on my domain as it is just for blogging/personal stuff.

It was good though to get the ball rolling on this side of things, and something else I now have some experience in how to do. I am going to do a short write up about it using the specific services I used, maybe on linkedin as I need to start being active on there too.

I have been running & gyming more again too, and it feels great. About half way through the Garmin training plan, which is just about to send me on a "Magic Mile" thing tomorrow, so hopefully i will have a good idea what my approximate race time should be come April.

The year is going OK, progress is slower than I'd hoped and still have yet to secure a position but I'm content at the moment and still plugging away!
